To do this efficiently:\n- Multiply 29 by 10 to get 290.\n- Then add another 29 to reach 319.\n\nFinally, since 11/2 is the same as dividing by 2, I'll divide 319 by 2 to obtain the final result of 159.5.\n</think>\n\nSure! Let's break down the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n\\[\n29 \\times 5.5 = 29 \\times \\left(5 + 0.5\\right) = (29 \\times 5) + (29 \\times 0.5)\n\\]\n\n1. **Multiply 29 by 5:**\n   \\[\n   29 \\times 5 = 145\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Multiply 29 by 0.5:**\n   \\[\n   29 \\times 0.5 = 14.5\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Add the two results together:**\n   \\[\n   145 + 14.5 = 159.5\n   \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{159.5}\n\\]",
